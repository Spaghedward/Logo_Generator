## Description

This command line script generates a custom logo based on user inputs.  The user can choose from different shapes and colors along with adding initials. 

## Installation

Inquirer module v8.2.4 is required to run this script. Jest v29.7.0 is needed to run the test. 

## Collaboration

Feel free to use this as you please.  I hope this simple script can make your life a little easier.

## Testing

There is a test for shapes.js using Jest.  It is located in the lib folder.
